                I was an intern at <a href="http://www.peraton.com">Peraton's Deep Space Network</a> in Monrovia, California. ^50

                communicate with manmade satellites beyond the Moon. ^50 As an intern, I helped modernize the intranet with different

                    I have been a part of my school's Science Olympiad team since my freshman year. 
                        ^100 <br><br>
                    I've competed in about 15 invitationals, ranging from those at high schools and those at universities
                    like <a href="www.mit.edu" class="blue">Massachussets Institution of Technology</a> and <a href="www.upenn.edu"
                    class="blue">University of Pennslyvania</a>. ^50 I've also competed in 2 regional, 2 state, and 2 national
                    competitions. 
                        ^100 <br><br>
                    I competed in Helicopters (9th, 10th), Wright Stuff (11th, 12th), Electric Wright 
                    Stuff (11th), Code Busters (11th), Boomilever (11th, 12th), Forensics (11th, 12th), and Mission Possible (11th).
                        ^100 <br><br>
                    Here's me at the Mira Loma invitational in 2017 with my Helicopter. It was my first 
                    ever Science Olympiad competition! <br>

                We compete in different conferences around the nation, helping to improve our speaking, leadership, and

                This is my club at the State Leadership Conference. Last year, we placed 2nd overall in the entire state of

                I have been a huge fan of Pokemon ever since a young age. ^50 My favorite pokemon are Buizel, Mew, and

                You can always catch me playing Pokemon Go in my free time. I love meeting people at raids and community days.
                ^50 <br> My trainer code is <span class="blue">3201 0279 5300</span>, so ^50 add me!

                Anyone who knows me knows that I am an avid boba enthusiast. ^50 I almost always have a 
                cup of boba with me.
                    ^100 <br><br>
                This means that I have been to a lot of boba places, which is why I decided to make a tier list
                for the stores that I've been to. ^50 This can help you decide where to drink if you are 
                in the LA/OC area!

                <br> If you don't know how tier lists work, the best places are 'S-tier', while the worst ones are 'F-tier'.
                    ^100 <br><br>
                I've gone into more details with specific spreadsheets for specific drinks at the different stores, so if you
                want information about that, contact me! (use the command <strong class="green">contact</strong> to do so!)
